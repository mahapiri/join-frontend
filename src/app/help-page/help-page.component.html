        we'll provide an overview of what <span class="blue">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>

    <h5>What is Join?</h5>
    <p><span class="blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
        students as part of their web development academy.<br><br>

        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit

    <h5>How to use it</h5>
    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="blue">Join</span>:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <div class="list-item">
                <article>Exploring the Board</article>
                <span>When you log in to <span class="blue">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project
                    and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</span>    
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="list-item">
                <article>Creating Contacts</article>
                <span>In <span class="blue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                    section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts
                    can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</span>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="list-item">
                <article>Adding Cards</article>
                <span>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
                    Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
                    the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</span>    
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="list-item">
                <article>Moving Cards</article>
                <span>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                    dropping the card from one list to another.</span>    
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="list-item">
                <article>Deleting Cards</article>
                <span>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
                    will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                    action is irreversible. Remember that using <span class="blue">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
                    updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project. Have
